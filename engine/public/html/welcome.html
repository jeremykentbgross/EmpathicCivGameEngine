		<p>FAQ:</p>
		<ol id="faq">
			<li>
				What is this?
				<p>
					EmpathicCivGameGameEngine is my Real Time Multiplayer HTML5 Game Engine
				</p>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				What does the name mean?
				<p>
					In the same way that the band "The Doors" chose their name in honor of a book named "The Doors of Perception",
					EmpathicCivGameGameEngine is also named in honor of a
					<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Empathic-Civilization-Global-Consciousness-Crisis/dp/1585427659"  target="_blank">
						book
					<a/>
					and an RSA talk by the same name and Author (Jeremy Rifkin):

				</p>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				Why Am I doing this?
				<p>
					Because I always wanted to make my own Games and build my own Engines.
					I have built a couple of Engines before professionally, and I have worked on UnrealEngine and CryEngine,
					but at present I don't know of anyone willing to pay me to build one again, nor to pay me to make the games I plan to make.
					So I am doing it on my time until I get around to a kickstarter or something.
					<br><br>

				</p>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				Are you making a game?
				<p>
					Yes.  I have several games I want to make with this tech, and at least one of them could be considered a whole new game genre.  So stay tuned.
				</p>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				Is there some kind of artistic/philosophical/moral/literary/social goal(s) you are going to be aiming for with this?
				<p>
					Yes.  I think if we compare video games to film we are still effectively black and white and silent.
					IMO we have not scratched the surface of what games can be, and I hope to help change that.
					The board game Monopoly was designed to teach players ideas through the mechanics themselves.
					Much is not yet understood about merging story and gameplay, maximizing cooperation in multiplayer,
					games for education, gamification of real world professional problems, etc.
					I think games could have a much bigger role in what human society is becoming than they currently do,
					and I want to explore my thoughts on the subject.
					And while my own specific thoughts and goals are very different, I highly recommend Jane McGonigal's TED talk:

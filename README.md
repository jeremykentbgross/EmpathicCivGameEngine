EmpathicCivGameEngine
=====================

EmpathicCivilGameEngine is an HTML5 / CSS3 / Nodejs Game Engine.

I started it as a hobby project after years of working on professional Game Engines, such as CryEngine3, UnrealEngine3, and building a couple of in house game engines from scratch at startups.

EmpathicCivilGameEngine depends on:

EmpathicCivGameEngine
=====================

**EmpathicCivilGameEngine is an HTML5 / CSS3 / Nodejs 2D Multiplayer Game Engine.**

This project is **STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!** - It is in Beta Testing as the Engine for my first Indie Game.

I started it as a personal project after years of working on professional Game Engines, such as CryEngine3, UnrealEngine3, and building a couple of in house game engines from scratch at startups.


Installation
===========

EmpathicCivilGameEngine depends on:

* [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) -- install

With nodejs installed run:

    cd bin
    ./RunNpmInstall
    ./SetupLinksDev


Basic Usage
=====

Run:

    cd bin
    ./RunServer

Or:

    cd bin
    ./NodeDebugger
    ./RunServer

Browse to the server you are running it on in your favorite modern browser (preferably Chrome as other browsers lack features such as AudioContext).

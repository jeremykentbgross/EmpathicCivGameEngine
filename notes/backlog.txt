Short term notes:
-http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5266152/how-to-exit-in-node-js
-Need to change icon!!
-move GameEngineLib.logger to GameInstance or something like that?
-clean scratchwork old files
-folders
--private/scripts/<engine/game>/?
-logger/debugdraw flags?
-physics component is ineriting entity NOT entitycomponent! WTF?!?! (is it still?)
-organize weblinks
-port in 'project' c#/c++ code: rays, A*, tree improvements
-port in minimmo rays and ??
-port/inspire in 2k4-5 map code
-html hidden image takes up space


Network:
-need to have object ownership!
-need to cleanup/improve setting/clearing netdirty (object level + class/instance net lists)
-position in serializer is not using floats
-InstanceID [0-255 || 0-65535] with range check (net object ids)
-port 80 default/null option
-ping t->; <-t*; dt(*)
-throw error in bit packer, and encoder and class reading on bad data + disconnect
-rename netDirty to isNetDirty
-bitpacker flags for network (ie not always to text, typed arrays?)
-creates new objects too often in serializer/airthmetic/bit packer?
-much in client side network needs to be in network wrapping the client/server code
-GameBinarySerialier.js not finished
-configure socketio (to use flash or whatever etc)
-prediction?
--physics.setServerPosition?? (physics component needs cleaning)
--See Source Engine Prediction
-console chat css


Tree updates:
-cpp port (recurse up clean) (minmmo dave, project (c# vers also), etc)
-merge like //option for map solids/surfaces/?vecFields?
-js _private/prototype
-indexOf etc
-node recycle	//recycler mixin?



Animation(s):
-
-*Character working


Localization:
-All Messages



Testing:
-test in ie6 or something for failure to support browser features (canvas, websockets, etc)
-Search for all TODO/todo/notes



Editor
-edit properties
-draw maps
-preview/create sprites
-particles
-backend db?



UI
-css(3)



Serializers
-net ser
-clone (needed?)
-fs?
-ui
-Json serializer



Engine features in game schedule:
-Particles (should be easy w/sprites)
-Ai systems (as needed)
-triggers (as needed)



Engine features in polish:
-Thread ai/physics/dom (main/render)
-map prerender



Physics changes:
-physics colors
-Fix multiple detect collisions like scenegraph (for being in different nodes, and report number of collisions in debug draw/print)
-Private
-owner Notice of collisions
-Accurate collision forces
-Friction
-Ridged body flag + triggers?
-forces live between timesteps?
-ray casts



Input:
-serialize
-see scratchwork



Linux network opts:
TCP_NODELAY
TCP_QUICKACK
TCP_THIN_LINEAR_TIMEOUTS
TCP_THIN_DUPACK



OTHER GOALS:
-Map Wrapping
-Proto/arch type entity factory
-Find and clean todos temps and hacks
-Class system cleanup
-animated tiles
-conversation trees
-AI
-event system sorting
--main update becomes an event^^^??
-Refactor components into systems??
-rename everything with out 'game' in the name
-rename GameRect to AABB2D, including instances
-update nodejs
-graphics system to create canvas (or three) and place it *IN DIV*
-make create class / find class+instanace functions in GameInstance to wrap class manager call
-Class function chains: instance.functionname.functionchaindown=true
-array.push instead of array[array.length - 1] = blah
-make event registry / factory so we know all the possible events and their data + can be created
-todo rename physics component to physics2D
-search and clean todo's
-Css width%
-Auto Resize?
-Event of resize
-Div container for graphics
-Warning frame catchup!??

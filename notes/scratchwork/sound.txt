/*
TEMP Daves notes about the footsteps:
There are 3 files, 1 is the 1st footstep and 2 and 2b are the second step for variety.
I recommend you randomize volume by around 30% and pitch up or down by up to 2 semi tones.
(200 cents) that should sound pretty good!
=>
semitone == halfstep == 100 cents == 1/12 of an octave.

playback = 1 * 2^(octave delta)
=>
playback = 1 * 2^(semiTone/12)

WINDOWS:
	SetupLinks.bat must be run from a cmd window which was started as administrator.
		Right clicking and running the bat directly at as administrator does not seem to work,
		so you must start the cmd window as Admin separately, navigate here, and then run it.
		Pain in the ass I know.  Windows right?
